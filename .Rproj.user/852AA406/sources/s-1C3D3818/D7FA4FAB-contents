## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
char1<-"你好"
char2<-'你好'
```

```{r}
char1Vector<-c("你好","How are you?")
```

#有時候內文有引號的話外面被迫要用單引號
```{r}
dialogue <- c('小明說："明天不用上課。"',
               '小花說："真的嗎？"')

cat(dialogue, sep="\n")
```

#Atomic: 6自動被轉成"6"了，一個vector應該都要是同一個class
```{r}
atomic<-c("roku",6)
```


```{r}
```


```{r}
```
